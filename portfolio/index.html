                      <p><b>This data strategy was evaluated by Gartner against a strategy by PwC, and received Gartner's
                          highest approval. The client moved to implement this within a few months with full stakeholder
                        buy-in across the organization.</b></p><br>
                    <p>This project comprised the conception of a data strategy for a US based hospital chain operating across 
                        3 states. We followed a tailored TOGAF framework for designing the enterprise data strategy. The data 
                        strategy included current state analysis, identification of issues and goals through stakeholder 
                        interviews, proposing a future state, and drawing a transformation road-map, staying mindful of 
                        security, governance, data management, analytics and reporting requirements, as well as other 
                        organizational needs. <br><br>
                    My role in this project was quite versatile. I led several phases of the project including the stakeholder 
                    interviews for identifying the current state problems, as well as in drawing up the future state 
                    architecture most suited to eradicate those problems and help achieve the organizational goals. I was also 
                    part of the team which put together a 2 year transformation roadmap to get to the future state.</p>

                                Using a dataset of power meter images uploaded by meter-readers across a metropolitan city, 
                                a cloud based solution was developed to extract the billing information from the picture and a

                      <p>CRM data was available, and an anomaly detection model was trained to identify shoppers buying products with the goal of
                        profit-making. The problem was challenging because the stores had enforced rule based constraints on some of these
                        products, and there were products whose purchase quantity or price, when compared to other products did not trigger
                        rules. Explainable surrogate models were also trained in order to make the decision-making rationale of the AI quite clear to

                      <p>Our client undertook a customer retention initiative and identified re-activation and re-capturing of dormant customers to
                        be an integral part of this.</p><br>
                      <p>An AI solution based on customer history, purchase patterns and tenure of interaction with the retailer was developed which
                        predicted the churn probability of a certain customer. The ML model predicted the specific customers whose probability fell
                        below the defined threshold thus allowing for a proactive and targeted reactivation strategy.</p><br>

                      <p>One of our reputed clients wanted to build an intrusion detection system as well as enforce an alerting mechanism in their
                        organisation which could warn them about systems behaving abnormally or performing suspicious activity.</p><br>
                      <p>Using the AWS cloud infrastructure, a real-time log ingestion mechanism was enacted to get the data into a data lake. This
                        data was then used for anomaly detection and highlighting the possibly compromised systems. These anomalies would then
                        generate alerts for the management. The AI Engine kept the score of logs from endpoints for anomalies, enabling the alerts
                        based on suspicious behavior indicators.</p><br>

                        created for deduplication which used word shingling and token based matching.</p>
