Homer's Iliad and the whole story of Troy is quite interesting in many aspects: love, battle, familial obligations, brotherhood, sacrifice, and revenge!

I watched the movie a long time ago, and was really inspired by the whole story as well. And it was memorable enough with the heroism and the battle scenes, and with Brad Pitt playing Achilles. (you've got to really love how he plays that part!)

What I found more interesting about the story, after I read an article years later was the contrast between Achilles and the oft-overlooked Hector.

Achilles is the perfect man. Conceived from a goddess, he was born perfect. Full of valor, undefeatable in battle, exalted in his charisma, fearing not even the mighty King Agamemnon, having a perfectly chiseled body fitting for a god, and facial features that would put even the most beautiful women to shame, and a natural at charming and pleasing women. He was a gifted one, and everything was too easy for him. Given his whole personality, what a man wouldn't give to be the image of that demigod!

Hector, on the other hand, was a mere mortal. He wasn't born with what he grew to have, he had to learn and earn it. He was not fearless in battle, nor was he the perfect warrior. He learned how to be brave and how to fight. It wasn't in his nature to be so. His nature was more compassionate, considerate, kind. What we'd call "a nice guy", who went out of his way to be kind to Helen while others blamed her for dooming them to war, who would have avoided the battle of Troy if it were upto him, who loved his brother and his wife and son too much to be unafraid of death while facing Achilles. He knew he was imperfect, and weak, but because of the very love that put fear in his heart, he had to learn to be brave and bold, and defended Troy for years against a huge army and a demigod.

When his wife begged him not to go to battle, telling him she feared for his life, he admitted his own fears and imperfections.


> "All this weighs on my mind too, dear woman.
But I would die of shame to face the men of Troy
and the Trojan women trailing their long robes
if I would shrink from battle now, a coward.
Nor does the spirit urge me on that way.
Iâ€™ve learned it all too well. To stand up bravely,
always to fight in the front ranks of Trojan soldiers,
winning my father great glory, glory for myself."



Hector wasn't born a perfect man, but strived to fight his weaknesses, and to play the roles he had in life all at the same time: a father, a husband, a brother, a son, a leader, a warrior, a commander. He did not shirk from any of them, and he did so by going against his nature.



I relate with Hector: an imperfect man!



I wasn't born with a big strong body, but I strive to change that.

I am not the most gifted with intelligence, but I learn.

I am not good at making friends, but I try to make the most out of an opportunity.

I often screw up in certain social situations, yet, I learn from what I did wrong the previous time.

I fall prey to temptations, but I keep struggling to fight them everyday.

I am not a natural fit for my vocation, and am handicapped against most co-workers, but I work hard to be the best at what I do.

I am not a good fit for the degree I want to pursue, (and I got rejected so many times for it) yet I keep trying again, and again.

I don't always feel ready for what life throws my way, but I learn to cope and make the best out of it.

I often feel lost, yet I learn to make better choices everyday, and strive to find my place in this world.

I feel powerless in certain life situations, yet I know I have to keep trying.



My nature goes against playing certain roles in life that I have to play. But for family, and for love, and for being a better me, I will make effort to play them!



I am not perfect! 



But I will not let that handicap me!



Like Hector, I will learn it all too well!



I will be genuine and real!



I will be Hector!
