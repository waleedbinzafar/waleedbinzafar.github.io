This picture of the plane with the red dots is very commonly used to describe the concept of survivorship bias, a concept I'd briefly like to touch upon before moving to its manifestation in Data Science. Basically, during WWII, Allied Forces were studying survived planes to determine where they should place better armour to increase the plane's chances of survival. They saw the obvious areas where bullet marks were present, and decided to reinforce those.

To their despair, and much bewilderment, these improvements to the plane design did not yield any better survival rates. The Allied Forces realised that they were focusing on planes that were surviving instead of looking at planes that were being shot down. The areas of assault on these survivor planes were already well-reinforced; instead, they had to look for areas where these survivor planes weren't being hit to determine where assault would have been fatal. This is the classical example of survivorship bias.

Coming to the Data Science world, I see a similar bias prevalent. The nascent industry is largely composed of fresher talent who look up-to their successful predecessors to decide the skills they want to prioritise and the areas they want to really focus on. Hence, they'd focus a lot on either complex statistical topics, or some niche area in Deep Learning that could work out for them as well as it did for [Joseph Redmon](pjreddie.com) (for the sake of a popular example).

The problem is, if you're an Allied Forces pilot trying to reinforce your proverbial plane through working on, and improving these skills, the foe's weapons are also evolving; market trends are shifting, and the required skillset has changed a lot. What could add value to the company you're trying to help with your skills, is not you writing some complex modelling algorithm and training a model from scratch, but something else entirely. 

The skillset of the "survivors" of the Data industry is helpful, but the freshers could do a lot good by also focusing on their **blindspots**: the skills not obvious from looking at the profile of someone who made it big in the industry.

So what can you do to reinforce your proverbial plane? How can you improve your chances of survival in the data war? You could bring value to your organisation through:

- having a business savoir-faire and the ability to connect the dots between what makes value for your company, the data that's available, and the algorithmic and open-source toolset out there
- being able to re-use other peoples' (open source) work creatively in order to solve problems; you don't want to waste time and money on reinventing the wheel (someone already built YOLO)
- being able to productionize and deploy ML solutions quickly in a scalable and fault tolerant fashion, as well as version and monitor it, and change models in deployment with minimal downtime without breaking the entire Machine Learning pipeline
- realising that managing and dealing with data quality and versioning issues is the bigger part of the problem, and a bigger fish to fry, than producing a mathematical solution to an optimisation problem
- familiarising yourself with explainable/interpretable Machine/Deep Learning, and truly understanding why it's important for business units to have some sort of insights into the *WHY's* of the black box Deep Learning model that you keep producing

Of course, these are only a few examples that I could quote off the top of my head. Being in a position where I have to interview a lot of fresh talent these are the most common skill-gaps I encounter, and I generally sense that survivorship bias is the reason. What made a resource good to have on a Data Science team 2 years ago, isn't the same today. With a lot of overwhelming development in the recent years, the odds of survival with the old proverbial armour are decreasing, and the data community would do well to recognise her blindspots and bias.
