In Spring 2023, I took the CS6400 Database Systems course as part of my Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program. Throughout the course, students are introduced to the principles and practices of database management systems, covering topics such as data modeling, query processing, and database design.

The course is well-structured, with lectures, readings, and assignments that build on each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of database management. One of the standout features of the course is the emphasis on hands-on experience, with assignments that require students to apply the concepts they have learned to real-world scenarios. 

I personally loved this approach since I got to work through my weak point in all phases of database design and implementation. This approach helps to reinforce learning and build practical skills, and I loved professor Leo's philosophy of learning by example and learning by doing.

### Key skills learned:

- Data modeling: I learned to create effective data models that accurately represent the data and meet requirements. I was able to apply tools like information flow diagrams and EER (extended entity relation) diagrams to synthesize a conceptual data model, and then distill it into a database schema.
- Query processing: I learned how to write and execute queries to efficiently retrieve data from large datasets. A large part of the course project was in designing and implementing reports as per specific requirements, and I helped one of my groupmates in making his queries efficient, so that the report loading time dropped from a 5 second lag, to the blink of an eye.
- Database design: I learned the best practices for designing databases that are scalable, secure, and meet the needs of the business; which entities should be broken down into specialized sub-entities, where should the attributes be stored, should there be constraints to fulfil before adding/removing data from a table.
- SQL programming: I gained more experience with SQL, the commonly used language for managing databases and retrieving data. I got a LOT of practice writing nested queries, and I'm not daunted by the prospect of writing monster queries now.
- Data normalization: learned how normalization works to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. As data scientists, we're mainly used to working with denormalized data, but it is important to learn normalization specially when managing data assets. All in all, it was a good skill gained.

### Major topics covered:

- Introduction to databases and database management systems
- Relational database model
- Data modeling and conceptual design
- SQL programming
- Query optimization and processing
- Database design and normalization
- Transactions and concurrency control
- Security and privacy

By mastering these skills and topics, I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of database management systems and the practical applications of database design and query processing in real-world data analytics scenarios. I can confidently say that I'll be applying these concepts in my practical life.

Overall, I highly recommend CS6400 to anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of database management systems and their applications in the field of data analytics. The course provides a solid foundation for further study and a valuable addition to any data professional's skillset.
