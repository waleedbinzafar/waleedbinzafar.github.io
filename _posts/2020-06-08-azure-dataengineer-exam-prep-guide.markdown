So in my most recent project, I have been working on designing a complete solution on Microsoft Azure. The comprehensiveness of the Big Data Platform being designed had me studying a lot of documentation, and experimenting with some of the features.  This post is intended as a guide on how to prepare for the AWS Big Data Specialty Exam. AWS specialty exams expect at least Associate level familiarity with the AWS ecosystem. 

## Path to Certification:
Two Exams

## Big Data Specialty: Key Areas

## Available learning resources:

### Linux Academy:


### Azure Documentation: 
The [documentation](insertlink) 


### Azure Free Learning Material:
On the AWS training website, you can find a bunch of free digital learning material. This material is officially produced with the test in mind, and hence is high quality. Highly recommended to go through this before attempting the exam.

#### Data Analytics Fundamentals: 
This course teaches you about the basics of Big Data and the AWS infrastructure that you can use to address the problems of Big Data. This course is very basic, and I would recommend this only if you are unfamiliar with the ABC of Big Data. Furthermore, it does not comprehensively go over all the services that we need to know for the exam, so not a very high recommendation for this course.
The course is available [here](https://www.aws.training/learningobject/wbc?id=35364).

#### Exam Readiness: AWS Big Data - Specialty (Digital): 
This one is a must before attempting the exam. It has a few Big Data use cases in different application domains (e.g. Finance, Health etc.) which are
highly relevant to the types of use cases that will turn up on the exam. A few common question types are also discussed, which will give you a true idea of the difficulty level of the actual exam.
The course is available [here](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=21332).

### Whitepapers
While there is a wide range of whitepapers available on the AWS website, I would not recommend investing time in reading these. The time investment is not worth the exam-relevant knowledge gained. The papers are written at a superficial level of abstraction that would not help much with the problems that come up on the exam.
