<p>Hi, I am Waleed Ahmad, and welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>This is a blog about Data Science, Cloud Technologies, Fitness, and Philosophical Conundrums among other things. Since you're here, I can imagine a number of things you'd possibly want to find out about me.</p>

<h3>Professional Life</h3><p>I'm a Pakistan based Data Scientist working at <a href=addo.ai>ADDO AI</a>. I work with enterprises operating at scale to help them address their data problems. I have led various projects designing and implementing artificial intelligence solutions for organisations operating in various domains ranging from Banking and Finance to Targeted Marketing.</p>
<p>I am experienced in Cloud Technologies and utilizing different cloud providers to build data and AI solutions. If you're interested in more details, here's a link to my <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/122U0CtEdrHbWMt8IBcW40agUPgkxuR_W/view?usp=sharing>Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Fitness</h3><p>Other than data, I am passionate about fitness, specifically Powerlifting. I have built a home gym to continue my own strength training. Here's me doing a heavy single in my home setup. Since I'm an Engineer, I took the liberty of designing my own squat-rack, and had it custom manufactured.</p>
