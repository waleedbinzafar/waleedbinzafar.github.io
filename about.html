        <h3>The business...</h3>
        <p>As a data practitioner and aficionado, I am dedicated to utilizing data to drive business success. My years of experience in machine learning and analytics have honed my skills in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making.</p>

        <p>Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to wear many hats, from plumbing data pipelines to configuring cloud infrastructure to support data architecture. While my primary focus has been on creating ML-powered solutions, I am equally comfortable building the data models that support advanced analytics.</p>

        <h3>... and the pleasure</h3>
        <p>Borderline millenial, fond of all kinds of teas, covers a song with guitar every once in a blue moon, loves powerlifting and rucking for fitness, enjoys a good book, and convinced of the efficacy of ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting.</p>
